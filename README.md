This branch is used to implement Time Series prediction using the package Facebook Prophet. It is separated in two files. The .py file where a class prophet_model is created and contains all the methods used to extract the data from our dataset, visualise the time series, and plot predictions. In the .ipynb file, we create an object and provide a sample of utilisation of the .py file.
